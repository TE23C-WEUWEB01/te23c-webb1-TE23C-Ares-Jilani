    <h1>Dear Diary,</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Dear diary, I don't know what's going on, but something's up<br>
        The dog won't stop barking, and I think my TV is bust<br>
        Every channel is the same, it's sending me insane<br>
        And earlier somebody bit me, what a fucking day</p>
    <p>The sky is falling<br>
        It's fucking boring<br>
        I'm going braindead, isolated<br>
        God is a shithead<br>
        And we're his rejects<br>
        Traumatized for breakfast<br>
        I can't stomach any more survival horror</p>
    <p>Dear diary, I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin<br>
        The dog's gone rabid (shut the fuck up)<br>
        Doing my head in<br>
        I keep fading in and out<br>
        I don't know where I've been<br>
        I feel so hungry<br>
        What the hell is happening?</p>
    <p>The sky is falling<br>
        It's fucking boring<br>
        I'm going braindead, isolated<br>
        God is a shithead<br>
        And we're his rejects<br>
        Traumatized for breakfast<br>
        I can't stomach any more survival horror</p>
    <p>Dear diary, dog stopped barking, probably 'cause I ate his face<br>
        Tasty, itchy, TV say there's no more human race<br>
        Kinda sad my whole entire existence been a waste<br>
        Ah, nevermind, it's not the end of the world (oh, wait)</p>
    <p>Fly</p>
    <p>Lie</p>

    <p>Sykes stated that the songs were written to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] In an interview with NME, Sykes would reveal a lot of different information about Post Human: Survival Horror. "Dear Diary," the introduction song was originally called "Survival Horror" and he wanted the song to be "fast and punky", as well as lyrically being about going into isolation and lockdown with Sykes expressing how he felt it made him feel like it was a zombie apocalypse with all of those feelings being written down into a diary to represent about how everyone feels being forced into isolation from society in an arising pandemic.[11]</p>
